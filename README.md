## Objective

To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a
test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google
Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

## Key Features:

- Filter events by city.
- Show or hide event details.
- Specify number of events that will be shown at a time
- Use the app when offline.
- Add shortcut to the home screen.
- View a chart showing the number of upcoming events city in each city

## User Stories:

- As a user, I should be able to click on an event so that I’ll be able to
  see more details about the event.

- As a user, I should be able to select the number of events that are
  displayed, so that I can manage how many events I see at a time.

- As a user, I should be able to use the app offline, so that I can
  check events when I don’t have internet connection.

- As a user, I should be able to see a chart with several
  upcoming events in each city, so that I can choose which event to attend.

## Technical Requirements

- React App
- TDD technique
- Google Calendar API and OAuth2 authentication
- Serverless functions (AWS lambda) for the authorization server
